the song would i guess be classified as like, black noise, death industrial? i really just would like to call it noise rock, as i had those 2 words in my head the entire time of making the track. took “NOISE rock” very literally though. most of the time there’s no melody behind the drums, it’s just drums over noise.

also, the art you see will not be the cover. it’s an artwork by stefan burnett, aka mc ride, aka rapper of death grips, aka angry man. i like to have a few temporary covers while making a song, so i can kinda attribute a sound to the image and ‘remake a photo sonically.’

this is the most descriptive i’ve ever been about something i’m making. appreciate it.

thanks for reading! :)

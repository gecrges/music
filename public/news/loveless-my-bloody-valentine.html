    <div class="content"><p>Writing a review for Loveless is a bit of an exercise in futility. What really is there to say about this record that hasn&#39;t already been said? The layers of sonic bliss that make up the content of this album have been endlessly dissected by every reviewer under the sun, and even the act of starting a review of it by acknowledging how unoriginal you sound is probably cliched enough at this point.</p>
<p>Yet, here I am, on what must be at least the 100th time I&#39;ve listened to this record in full (and that&#39;s a very, very conservative estimate), and I feel like I&#39;m doing the album itself a disservice if I don&#39;t mindlessly gush about how it&#39;s essentially changed my understanding of what music can be.</p>
<p>Shoegaze was a genre that I had a bit of a rough time getting into. I was first exposed to Loveless whilst unsuspectingly checking out the RYM top all time album chart. It wasn&#39;t a record I was familiar with, and having listened to the majority of the top 10 already I figured I&#39;d give it a go in a free study period at school. As soon as the introducing spatter of Only Shallow&#39;s drums gave way to that sea of guitar lines, I was immediately disoriented, confused, curious - essentially every possible reaction you could have to an album was going through my head at that singular moment. The more I listened, I felt like I was growing frustrated with the album. This sea of droing noise wasn&#39;t quite like anything I&#39;d ever heard, and yet I felt this odd fascination to keep listening.</p>
<p>For a while, I avoided returning to the record. I think I gave it a middling score (if memory serves me correctly, a 6/10, which is a sin for which I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll atone in whatever hellish afterlife I end up in) and tried to move on with my life. Despite that, though, the album just kept calling out to me, in a way that I hadn&#39;t experienced previously (or indeed, with almost any other records since).</p>
<p>So, I tried alternative routes to get into the genre. To cut a long story short, Nowhere ended up serving as my proper jumping off point, getting me more familiar and accepting of this usage of beautiful, overwhelming guitar noise being overlayed atop otherwise catchy and memorable indie rock tracks. It was only after I owned that record on vinyl, had sworn myself as a Ride devotee, and checked out various other albums from the genre (including Just for a Day, as for some reason at the time I was adament that I didn&#39;t enjoy Souvlaki) that I knew I was ready to hear Loveless again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, everything clicked into place. It was like seeing the album in a whole new light. This thick sea of noise wasn&#39;t something to wade through in search of a discernible pop song - it was a beautiful textural adornment, a layer of screaming bliss atop some of the most gorgeous and catchy hits that never were.</p>
<p>The first one to really click was &quot;Sometimes&quot;, which feels like a somewhat contradictory statement considering I just put so much stock into the fantastic pop songwriting on the record, with the thick, hypnotic droning guitar on &quot;Sometimes&quot; proving to be one of the less pop-inspired tracks on the record. Despite that, though, this song is one of the most beautiful things I&#39;ve ever heard in my life. A suffocated, slowly fading acoustic guitar drowns as it fades away beneath a wall of low end fuzz, with Kevin&#39;s longing vocals faintly crying out as they glide above it all. The solitary organ in the background serves as the perfect addition to send the song towards truly stratospheric heights, and after its excellent usage in the equally brilliant &#39;Lost in Translation&#39; any chance of this song escaping my mind was gone. This is my current favourite track on the whole record, but that accolade changes so frequently that trying to give it out to any particular track is a waste of time.</p>
<p>&quot;When You Sleep&quot; is the moment where you really start to realise Loveless is, at its heart, just a fantastic pop record. The mark of a truly fantastic shoegaze song is often one that can be retranslated to acoustic guitar without losing an ounce of their effectiveness, and &quot;When You Sleep&quot; is certainly no exception to this, as hundreds of indie YouTube covers have taught me over the years. It&#39;s a distinction shared with another of shoegaze&#39;s finest moments, that being &quot;Alison&quot; by Slowdive, despite both songs taking such a radically different approach to the sound of shoegaze. &quot;When You Sleep&quot; is easily the most accessible track on the record, with the sea of noise serving as a somewhat accessible overlay compared to many of the tracks surrounded by it (and trust me, we&#39;ll get onto those). It surprises me that, bar a brief stint as a radio-only promo track, this track was never one that Creation attempted to push as a single. Maybe they were just concerned that anyone who listened to it would become so dangerously infatuated with the record that it could cause mass hysteria.</p>
<p>We&#39;re going very out of order on this brief track-by-track, but I really ought to touch on the sonic masterpiece that is &quot;To Here Knows When&quot;. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a single other song on this album (or, indeed, ever) that can replicate the feeling of ascending to the heavens quite like this one can. The droning, snarling guitar line hangs so delicately over the oddly danceable drum beat and the lead synth (?) line, as you&#39;re serenaded by Bilinda&#39;s vocals into a state of complete and utter bliss. This track, and I mean this with not an ounce of hyperbole, feels like it&#39;s a representation of the heat death of the universe. I&#39;m sure that may sound ridiculously pretentious to most, but trust me, if you&#39;re as much of a fan of this record as I am, it&#39;s not a particularly controversial statement to make.</p>
<p>&quot;Only Shallow&quot; surely has to be one of the single most daring openers to a record ever. The slight drum count in is the only warning and respite you&#39;ll get before an onslaught of guitar bends come to wage war on your audio system. The power chords powering the noisy chorus along give the song all the energy it needs, and Bilinda&#39;s vocals are at what is arguably their peak, whispering vaguely sexual (?) promises as the tremolo strumming entrances you into a state of complete delirium.</p>
<p>I find the album&#39;s closer, &quot;Soon&quot;, to be the closest Loveless gets to even vaguely acknowledging the contemporary 90s music scene surrounding it at the time. Backed up by a sampled, instantly catchy baggy style drum loop, the fuzzy guitar that kicks in during the verse is the only real indication that this isn&#39;t the next chart hit from the likes of The Stone Roses or Happy Mondays. It ultimately serves as the perfect closer, offering a dance-inspired point of reference for those who wouldn&#39;t normally listen to a shoegaze record, all the while continuing to tear their face off with a wave of gorgeously thick guitar layering.</p>
<p>Out of fear of this review being an incomprehensible wall of praise, I&#39;ll refrain from overly analysing the other tracks - please don&#39;t interpret this as any sort of statement on their quality (indeed, &quot;What You Want&quot; and &quot;Loomer&quot; are two of the most underrated tracks on the entire album, and outside of the off-kilter interlude track that is &quot;Touched&quot; the album doesn&#39;t really stray from perfection once throughout its runtime), but rather not wanting to repeat the compliments I&#39;ve already given.</p>
<p>Loveless reportedly almost bankrupted Creation Records (although the reliability of Alan McGee&#39;s statements on the matter has been called into question many a time), and the entire process drove many of its staff mad. Yet, every single second that Kevin Shields and co. spent perfecting this utter masterpiece of an album clearly did not go to waste. It serves as a statue in a genre, and it arguably almost killed shoegaze before it could even develop because of the simple fact that nobody could live up to its brilliance. In another timeline, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s years of build up in the realm of droning ambient noise that comes to explain &quot;To Here Knows When&quot;, or some subset of danceable shoegaze that one can draw comparisons with in the case of &quot;Soon&quot;. But this is not that timeline. Kevin Shields was just such a visionary that he essentially laid all the groundwork himself, and left it up to his successors to take what Loveless had done and reinterpret it. Even if Loveless may only be my second favourite album of all time (at time of writing, the noisy emo perfection on After the Night just about pips it to the post), I cannot deny that it is the single most influential and important album wthin shoegaze as a genre, and anyone who denies such a sentiment needs to stop lying to themselves.</p>
<p>Loveless is perfect. It&#39;s the most beautiful noise you could ever ask for, in every single quantifiable form.</p>

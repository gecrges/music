    <div class="content"><p>I, too, hate the boys at school<br><strong>The Turning Wheel</strong> (2021) - <strong>Spellling</strong></p>
<p>I usually don&#39;t do reviews for things I watch or listen to, but this one really deserves a review. Because this album really made me rethink the way I enjoy music, how I interact with albums, and what kind of music I actually like. Generally speaking, when I fall in love with an album or movie or really anything, it happens in a flash. I immediately know I love it, and I know at the very first enjoyment of it that I&#39;ll be loving the thing for a long time. But not with The Turning Wheel.</p>
<p>When I first listened to this album, I would&#39;ve given it a solid 8/10. I listened to it from mediocre earphones on a walk, and I was semi-uncomfortable with Spellling&#39;s singing style on the album, which I would compare to Kate Bush the most with some other influences that are more ephemeral. The album also starts with the song that has, in my opinion, the most jarring vocal performance on the record prior to getting used to the style. After I listened to it again, I did it on my good headphones at home and the second listen-through changed the album, in my mind, to a weak 9/10.</p>
<p>The fourth or fifth time, though, I listened to the record on my incredible JBL monitors and with a few friends. I really paid attention to it, and something snapped in my head and I started to absolutely love Spellling&#39;s singing. When that piece of the puzzle snapped in place, everything else did as well. The instrumentation is incredible, the compositions are beautiful (especially the melodies), and the whole thing feels like a theatrical Disney-esque experience of wonder and beauty. The mixing and mastering is probably the best I&#39;ve <em>ever</em> heard on an album with live instrumentation, which really brings the orchestral parts of the album to another level since you can hear everything clearly.</p>
<p>The thing that really surprised me on a personal level is that I&#39;d have never in my life thought I&#39;d love an album that sounds like The Turning Wheel. When I listen to music, the things I&#39;m most likely to appreciate and even more likely to be truly impressed by are usually albums like To Be Kind from Swans and You Won&#39;t Get What You Want by Daughters. That is to say, albums with the absolute extremes of human emotion expressed through loud and experimental music. The Turning Wheel does not sound anything like that. The emotion in the album is found in the compositions, the stunning lyrics &amp; vocal performance from Spellling, and in the nigh-religious experience I had with some of the songs on the album.</p>
<p>The song I will highlight the most is Boys At School, which absolutely floored me even on the first listen when I was generally unimpressed by the album, but which has now become a song that gives me chills even after 30+ listens to it. It&#39;s hard to describe why exactly, but the composition and instrumentation and vocal performance on this song perfectly coalesce with its lyrics and theme. The two bridges have a melody that I could only describe as transcendent, which is a ludicrous word to use for music in almost every case. And perhaps it&#39;s just the theme of the song hitting so close home, but the the melody really makes me remember how it was to be an ostracized teenager in school. I wish I had the knowledge in music theory to analyse it, but something in it feels exactly like I do when I remember all that pain and loneliness while not feeling too &quot;edgy&quot;. It just sounds perfect. What more can I say?</p>
<p>In summary, Spellling&#39;s The Turning Wheel has changed the way I approach music, and given me an entirely new perspective on the kind of music I can not just enjoy, but be enamoured by. I cannot imagine anything this year topping this album, since I can&#39;t remember the last time an album made me feel like this does each and every listen.</p>
<p><strong>Perfection.</strong></p>
<p><strong>10.0/10</strong></p>

    <div class="content"><p><strong>preface</strong>: everything in this description that is written in between [brackets] is not true anymore as the song has evolved a lot since i initially wrote this description. i could rewrite it but i&#39;d like for you to know my thoughts during the process of making the song. you&#39;ll just have to imagine how whatever i&#39;m referring to sounded until i (maybe) someday publish an earlier version of the song :D</p>
<p>the idea behind the lyrics and song title is the lack of meaning, and the creation thereof when first listening to the song. say a song has a sad or dark title, you&#39;ll have the foreknowledge of it being a sad song before ever hearing it (obviously). &#39;Yuawa Iguo&#39; is meaningless, written in a non-existent language. someone listening to it for the first time will have no clue of what mood the song will be.</p>
<p>when i first listened to lingua ignota (aka kristin hayter), i had no idea what to expect in terms of sound, because of the name. when i think of &quot;lingua ignota&quot; now, i think of literal agony and desperation. it&#39;s the feeling and meaning i subconsciously added to the name after i heard her music. that&#39;s what Yuawa Iguo is supposed to be.</p>
<p>funnily enough, this song started out as easily one of my calmest (unreleased) tracks ever. it was supposed to be a nice ambient piece... it&#39;s safe to say it didn&#39;t evolve into one. the initial concept was made on 7-19-2025[, that being the deep strings you hear with the weird noisy pluck with an insanely long tail, around the start of the track].</p>
<p>the next day, i worked on it some more and added some weird noise synth... just to forget about the entire project until the end of the month. until i found it again, i forgot it&#39;d ever existed, haha. i was scrolling through my projects on 7-30, because what&#39;s the point of starting a new project with older unfinished song ideas already sitting there, yk. i opened the project and i continued working on it, still with the ambient idea in mind.</p>
<p>the exact part where the the transition between calm and loud [is] (was, at the time of writing this), was supposed to transition into... the same calmness, just with more instruments. i laid that exact thing down, but then removed it and added the aggressive drums you hear now. i don&#39;t know what made me refrain from the initial idea, but i&#39;m glad i did. i myself love the route this track took more than whatever ambient thing i could&#39;ve made it to be in some alternate universe........</p>
<p>oh yeah, fun fact, most of the screamo background vocals were not recorded for this track! i recorded them a whiiiiile back, inspired by 100 gecs, believe it or not. specifically the outro to 800 db cloud. that part is so cool.</p>
<p>find the song <a href="../listen.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>thanks for reading :)<br>much love, georges</p>

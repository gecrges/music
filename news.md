**preface**: everything in this description that is written in between \[brackets] is not true anymore as the song has evolved a lot since i initially wrote this description. i could rewrite it but i'd like for you to know my thoughts during the process of making the song. you'll just have to imagine how whatever i'm referring to sounded until i (maybe) someday publish an earlier version of the song :D


the idea behind the lyrics and song title is the lack of meaning, and the creation thereof when first listening to the song. say a song has a sad or dark title, you'll have the foreknowledge of it being a sad song before ever hearing it (obviously). 'Yuawa Iguo' is meaningless, written in a non-existent language. someone listening to it for the first time will have no clue of what mood the song will be.

when i first listened to lingua ignota (aka kristin hayter), i had no idea what to expect in terms of sound, because of the name. when i think of "lingua ignota" now, i think of literal agony and desperation. it's the feeling and meaning i subconsciously added to the name after i heard her music. that's what Yuawa Iguo is supposed to be.

funnily enough, this song started out as easily one of my calmest (unreleased) tracks ever. it was supposed to be a nice ambient piece... it's safe to say it didn't evolve into one. the initial concept was made on 7-19-2025[, that being the deep strings you hear with the weird noisy pluck with an insanely long tail, around the start of the track].

the next day, i worked on it some more and added some weird noise synth... just to forget about the entire project until the end of the month. until i found it again, i forgot it'd ever existed, haha. i was scrolling through my projects on 7-30, because what's the point of starting a new project with older unfinished song ideas already sitting there, yk. i opened the project and i continued working on it, still with the ambient idea in mind.

the exact part where the the transition between calm and loud \[is] (was, at the time of writing this), was supposed to transition into... the same calmness, just with more instruments. i laid that exact thing down, but then removed it and added the aggressive drums you hear now. i don't know what made me refrain from the initial idea, but i'm glad i did. i myself love the route this track took more than whatever ambient thing i could've made it to be in some alternate universe........

oh yeah, fun fact, most of the screamo background vocals were not recorded for this track! i recorded them a whiiiiile back, inspired by 100 gecs, believe it or not. specifically the outro to 800 db cloud. that part is so cool.

find the song [here](listen.html).

thanks for reading :)  
much love, georges

I, too, hate the boys at school  
**The Turning Wheel** (2021) - **Spellling**

I usually don't do reviews for things I watch or listen to, but this one really deserves a review. Because this album really made me rethink the way I enjoy music, how I interact with albums, and what kind of music I actually like. Generally speaking, when I fall in love with an album or movie or really anything, it happens in a flash. I immediately know I love it, and I know at the very first enjoyment of it that I'll be loving the thing for a long time. But not with The Turning Wheel.

When I first listened to this album, I would've given it a solid 8/10. I listened to it from mediocre earphones on a walk, and I was semi-uncomfortable with Spellling's singing style on the album, which I would compare to Kate Bush the most with some other influences that are more ephemeral. The album also starts with the song that has, in my opinion, the most jarring vocal performance on the record prior to getting used to the style. After I listened to it again, I did it on my good headphones at home and the second listen-through changed the album, in my mind, to a weak 9/10.

The fourth or fifth time, though, I listened to the record on my incredible JBL monitors and with a few friends. I really paid attention to it, and something snapped in my head and I started to absolutely love Spellling's singing. When that piece of the puzzle snapped in place, everything else did as well. The instrumentation is incredible, the compositions are beautiful (especially the melodies), and the whole thing feels like a theatrical Disney-esque experience of wonder and beauty. The mixing and mastering is probably the best I've *ever* heard on an album with live instrumentation, which really brings the orchestral parts of the album to another level since you can hear everything clearly.

The thing that really surprised me on a personal level is that I'd have never in my life thought I'd love an album that sounds like The Turning Wheel. When I listen to music, the things I'm most likely to appreciate and even more likely to be truly impressed by are usually albums like To Be Kind from Swans and You Won't Get What You Want by Daughters. That is to say, albums with the absolute extremes of human emotion expressed through loud and experimental music. The Turning Wheel does not sound anything like that. The emotion in the album is found in the compositions, the stunning lyrics & vocal performance from Spellling, and in the nigh-religious experience I had with some of the songs on the album.

The song I will highlight the most is Boys At School, which absolutely floored me even on the first listen when I was generally unimpressed by the album, but which has now become a song that gives me chills even after 30+ listens to it. It's hard to describe why exactly, but the composition and instrumentation and vocal performance on this song perfectly coalesce with its lyrics and theme. The two bridges have a melody that I could only describe as transcendent, which is a ludicrous word to use for music in almost every case. And perhaps it's just the theme of the song hitting so close home, but the the melody really makes me remember how it was to be an ostracized teenager in school. I wish I had the knowledge in music theory to analyse it, but something in it feels exactly like I do when I remember all that pain and loneliness while not feeling too "edgy". It just sounds perfect. What more can I say?

In summary, Spellling's The Turning Wheel has changed the way I approach music, and given me an entirely new perspective on the kind of music I can not just enjoy, but be enamoured by. I cannot imagine anything this year topping this album, since I can't remember the last time an album made me feel like this does each and every listen.

**Perfection.**

**10.0/10**

Writing a review for Loveless is a bit of an exercise in futility. What really is there to say about this record that hasn't already been said? The layers of sonic bliss that make up the content of this album have been endlessly dissected by every reviewer under the sun, and even the act of starting a review of it by acknowledging how unoriginal you sound is probably cliched enough at this point.

Yet, here I am, on what must be at least the 100th time I've listened to this record in full (and that's a very, very conservative estimate), and I feel like I'm doing the album itself a disservice if I don't mindlessly gush about how it's essentially changed my understanding of what music can be.

Shoegaze was a genre that I had a bit of a rough time getting into. I was first exposed to Loveless whilst unsuspectingly checking out the RYM top all time album chart. It wasn't a record I was familiar with, and having listened to the majority of the top 10 already I figured I'd give it a go in a free study period at school. As soon as the introducing spatter of Only Shallow's drums gave way to that sea of guitar lines, I was immediately disoriented, confused, curious - essentially every possible reaction you could have to an album was going through my head at that singular moment. The more I listened, I felt like I was growing frustrated with the album. This sea of droing noise wasn't quite like anything I'd ever heard, and yet I felt this odd fascination to keep listening.

For a while, I avoided returning to the record. I think I gave it a middling score (if memory serves me correctly, a 6/10, which is a sin for which I'm sure I'll atone in whatever hellish afterlife I end up in) and tried to move on with my life. Despite that, though, the album just kept calling out to me, in a way that I hadn't experienced previously (or indeed, with almost any other records since).

So, I tried alternative routes to get into the genre. To cut a long story short, Nowhere ended up serving as my proper jumping off point, getting me more familiar and accepting of this usage of beautiful, overwhelming guitar noise being overlayed atop otherwise catchy and memorable indie rock tracks. It was only after I owned that record on vinyl, had sworn myself as a Ride devotee, and checked out various other albums from the genre (including Just for a Day, as for some reason at the time I was adament that I didn't enjoy Souvlaki) that I knew I was ready to hear Loveless again.

Suddenly, everything clicked into place. It was like seeing the album in a whole new light. This thick sea of noise wasn't something to wade through in search of a discernible pop song - it was a beautiful textural adornment, a layer of screaming bliss atop some of the most gorgeous and catchy hits that never were.

The first one to really click was "Sometimes", which feels like a somewhat contradictory statement considering I just put so much stock into the fantastic pop songwriting on the record, with the thick, hypnotic droning guitar on "Sometimes" proving to be one of the less pop-inspired tracks on the record. Despite that, though, this song is one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard in my life. A suffocated, slowly fading acoustic guitar drowns as it fades away beneath a wall of low end fuzz, with Kevin's longing vocals faintly crying out as they glide above it all. The solitary organ in the background serves as the perfect addition to send the song towards truly stratospheric heights, and after its excellent usage in the equally brilliant 'Lost in Translation' any chance of this song escaping my mind was gone. This is my current favourite track on the whole record, but that accolade changes so frequently that trying to give it out to any particular track is a waste of time.

"When You Sleep" is the moment where you really start to realise Loveless is, at its heart, just a fantastic pop record. The mark of a truly fantastic shoegaze song is often one that can be retranslated to acoustic guitar without losing an ounce of their effectiveness, and "When You Sleep" is certainly no exception to this, as hundreds of indie YouTube covers have taught me over the years. It's a distinction shared with another of shoegaze's finest moments, that being "Alison" by Slowdive, despite both songs taking such a radically different approach to the sound of shoegaze. "When You Sleep" is easily the most accessible track on the record, with the sea of noise serving as a somewhat accessible overlay compared to many of the tracks surrounded by it (and trust me, we'll get onto those). It surprises me that, bar a brief stint as a radio-only promo track, this track was never one that Creation attempted to push as a single. Maybe they were just concerned that anyone who listened to it would become so dangerously infatuated with the record that it could cause mass hysteria.

We're going very out of order on this brief track-by-track, but I really ought to touch on the sonic masterpiece that is "To Here Knows When". I don't think there's a single other song on this album (or, indeed, ever) that can replicate the feeling of ascending to the heavens quite like this one can. The droning, snarling guitar line hangs so delicately over the oddly danceable drum beat and the lead synth (?) line, as you're serenaded by Bilinda's vocals into a state of complete and utter bliss. This track, and I mean this with not an ounce of hyperbole, feels like it's a representation of the heat death of the universe. I'm sure that may sound ridiculously pretentious to most, but trust me, if you're as much of a fan of this record as I am, it's not a particularly controversial statement to make.

"Only Shallow" surely has to be one of the single most daring openers to a record ever. The slight drum count in is the only warning and respite you'll get before an onslaught of guitar bends come to wage war on your audio system. The power chords powering the noisy chorus along give the song all the energy it needs, and Bilinda's vocals are at what is arguably their peak, whispering vaguely sexual (?) promises as the tremolo strumming entrances you into a state of complete delirium.

I find the album's closer, "Soon", to be the closest Loveless gets to even vaguely acknowledging the contemporary 90s music scene surrounding it at the time. Backed up by a sampled, instantly catchy baggy style drum loop, the fuzzy guitar that kicks in during the verse is the only real indication that this isn't the next chart hit from the likes of The Stone Roses or Happy Mondays. It ultimately serves as the perfect closer, offering a dance-inspired point of reference for those who wouldn't normally listen to a shoegaze record, all the while continuing to tear their face off with a wave of gorgeously thick guitar layering.

Out of fear of this review being an incomprehensible wall of praise, I'll refrain from overly analysing the other tracks - please don't interpret this as any sort of statement on their quality (indeed, "What You Want" and "Loomer" are two of the most underrated tracks on the entire album, and outside of the off-kilter interlude track that is "Touched" the album doesn't really stray from perfection once throughout its runtime), but rather not wanting to repeat the compliments I've already given.

Loveless reportedly almost bankrupted Creation Records (although the reliability of Alan McGee's statements on the matter has been called into question many a time), and the entire process drove many of its staff mad. Yet, every single second that Kevin Shields and co. spent perfecting this utter masterpiece of an album clearly did not go to waste. It serves as a statue in a genre, and it arguably almost killed shoegaze before it could even develop because of the simple fact that nobody could live up to its brilliance. In another timeline, I'm sure there's years of build up in the realm of droning ambient noise that comes to explain "To Here Knows When", or some subset of danceable shoegaze that one can draw comparisons with in the case of "Soon". But this is not that timeline. Kevin Shields was just such a visionary that he essentially laid all the groundwork himself, and left it up to his successors to take what Loveless had done and reinterpret it. Even if Loveless may only be my second favourite album of all time (at time of writing, the noisy emo perfection on After the Night just about pips it to the post), I cannot deny that it is the single most influential and important album wthin shoegaze as a genre, and anyone who denies such a sentiment needs to stop lying to themselves.

Loveless is perfect. It's the most beautiful noise you could ever ask for, in every single quantifiable form.
